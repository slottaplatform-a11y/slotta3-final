# Email Setup (Placeholder)

Slotta includes a minimal email helper for future integration.

## Environment Variables

Set these in production:

```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## Notes

- No emails are sent automatically in the MVP.
- The helper returns a placeholder response until real integration is added.
