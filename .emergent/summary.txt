<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a sophisticated booking and payment platform, originally named TimeHold, then AuraSync, and now finalized as Slotta. The core feature is protecting professionals' time from no-shows by placing a smart, calculated hold on a client's card via Stripe, rather than a full upfront charge.

The initial request was to create a roadmap, but the user quickly pivoted to wanting a full visual prototype of the entire platform. After the UI was built and refined, the user provided all necessary API keys (Stripe, SendGrid, Telegram, Google Calendar) and a detailed list of tasks to make the platform fully functional.

The current goal is to connect the entire frontend to the already-built backend, make all buttons and forms functional, implement a master authentication system, and build out the complete booking flow with real payment authorizations.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
- A full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend using MongoDB.
- The platform has been fully rebranded to Slotta across the entire codebase.
- A complete 12-page visual frontend has been built using mock data.
- A comprehensive backend is in place with Pydantic models, a  for hold calculations, and over 20 API endpoints for all CRUD operations and business logic.
- All 3rd party integrations (Stripe, SendGrid, Telegram, Google Calendar) are configured on the backend with user-provided API keys and confirmed to be enabled via a health check endpoint.
- Several frontend pages have been partially or fully connected to the backend:
    - ****: Fully connected and showing real stats.
    - ****: Fully connected with working Add and Edit modals.
    - ****: Includes the structure for a Block Time modal.
    - ****: Includes the structure for a Message Client modal.
    - ****: Forms are using controlled components, ready for API connection.
    - ****: Partially connected to fetch data.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: Connecting the  page to the backend. The agent successfully added the  hook to fetch the list of bookings and began modifying the JSX to render the real data from the API instead of mock data.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent. After the agent connects all the pages, it should use the testing agent to verify that data is being displayed correctly and that all forms submit data as expected. For individual page connections, the main agent can use the screenshot tool.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Incomplete Frontend-to-Backend Connection (P0)**
    - The  page connection is in progress. The data fetching is implemented, but the JSX rendering needs to be completed to match the API response data structure.
- **Issue 2: Non-Functional UI Elements (P1)**
    - Many buttons across the platform are not yet wired to an API call. This includes Block Time on the Calendar, Save Changes on Settings, and Message Client on the Booking Detail page.
- **Issue 3: Missing Authentication Flow (P1)**
    - There is no user signup or login functionality. The master dashboard is currently not protected.
- **Issue 4: Incomplete Core Booking Flow (P2)**
    - The public booking page does not yet create a booking in the database, authorize a payment with Stripe, or trigger notifications.

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1: Incomplete Frontend-to-Backend Connection**
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent started connecting the  page.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1. Open .
        2. Verify that the  function correctly accesses properties from the  object as defined in  (e.g., , ).
        3. Complete the JSX updates to display all relevant booking information.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will make the Bookings page functional, showing real data to the master user. It's a critical step toward completing the dashboard.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

- **Issue 2: Non-Functional UI Elements**
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent created the modal structures for Block Time and Message Client but has not yet implemented the API submission logic.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1. For each non-functional button (e.g., in , ), implement an  or  handler.
        2. Inside the handler, call the corresponding function from .
        3. Ensure the API calls send the correct payload to the backend endpoints.
        4. Add state management for loading states and display success/error feedback to the user.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will make the application interactive and usable, fulfilling a core user request.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

- **Issue 3: Missing Authentication Flow**
    - **Attempted fixes**: None yet.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1. Create new pages for Master Signup and Login.
        2. Add  and  (for signup) endpoints to the backend if not already fully implemented for auth.
        3. On login, store the returned JWT in local storage.
        4. Update  to include the JWT in the  header for all protected requests.
        5. Implement a protected route component that wraps the master dashboard and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will secure the master's data and is essential for a production application.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Connect  to Backend API**
    - **Where to resume**: . The agent needs to finish updating the JSX inside the  function to correctly render the data being fetched from the  endpoint.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: The master's booking list will display real, dynamic data from the database.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    - **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

**changes in tech stack**
The original user document mentioned PostgreSQL, but the agent correctly identified and used the existing MongoDB setup. No other changes were made.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains all backend API endpoints and business logic.
- : Stores all third-party API keys and database configuration.
- : A crucial utility for centralizing all frontend API calls to the backend.
- : The directory containing all pages for the master dashboard that need to be connected to the backend.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file will need to be updated to handle JWT authentication by adding the  header to requests.
- As frontend components become more complex with data fetching and state, consider using  for better state management.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Priority is Functionality**: The user's primary goal is to make the application fully functional. Focus on connecting the UI to the backend, implementing forms, and enabling the core booking and authentication flows.
- **All Keys are Present**: You do not need to ask for any API keys. They are all in  and the backend is already configured to use them.
- **Follow the Plan**: Address the pending tasks systematically, starting with connecting the remaining data pages, then implementing authentication, and finally tackling the full Stripe booking flow.
- **Project Name**: The project is **Slotta**. Do not use TimeHold or AuraSync.
